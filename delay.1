.IX Title "DELAY 1"
.TH DELAY 1 "2002-02-09" "Delay 1.5" "OneGeek Software"
.UC
.SH "NAME"
delay \- counts down a specified number of seconds.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 2
\&  delay [options] <length> [-- command]
\&  delay [options] until <timespec> [-- command]
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The delay program counts down a length of time specified on
the command line. By default, it prints out the time remaining
once a second. The rate and style of printing can be controlled
using options to the program. This includes the ability to 
supress the printing entirely. It also somewhat supports delaying
for fractional seconds.
.PP
Delay attempts to compensate for the time it spends printing the
updates. There should be no error that is a multiple of the 
time spent delaying. (There is a bit of error on the startup
and termination of the program, but that's unavoidable.)
.PP
There are several ways that the time to delay can be
specified. The first is that it can be specified as an absolute length
of time to delay. This can be in several formats. All of the following
formats are allowable. (And equivalent.)
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  delay 1d 2:03:04.5
\&  delay 1d 2h 3m 4.5s
\&  delay 93785.5
.Ve
Please note that the fractional seconds code will only work for actual 
fractional seconds. So, doing things like '0.5h' will delay for half
a second, and not for half an hour as one may expect. (But don't rely
on this behavior, as it may change in future versions.)
.PP
The second format is for a time to delay until be specified. The
time parsing code is derived from that used it at, and as a result
the time specifications should be described on \fIat\fR\|(1). For example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  delay until 4 pm
\&  delay until noon tomorrow
\&  delay until midnight 13 september 2000
\&  delay until now + 5 minutes
.Ve
Please note that the parsing code has a resolution of a minute. So, the
last specification would calculate the 5 minutes from the beginning of
the current minute, and delay to that absolute point in time. If you need
more precision, you can use the first time format, which allows an 
the delay length to be specified precisely. 
.PP
If delay sees \*(L"\-\-\*(R" while parsing it's command line, it stops argument 
processing. Instead, the argument after the \*(L"\-\-\*(R" is interpreted as a 
command to be run when delay completes, and any further arguments are
used as arguments to that command. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  delay until 9:30 -- cdplay
.Ve
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Delay allows you to use command line options to control aspects of its
behavior. Here's a list:
.IP "\-q" 4
.IX Item "-q"
This enables quiet mode. This prevents delay from outputting the 
time remaining as it usually does. (This is the default if
delay is called with \*(L"sleep\*(R" as part of the program name.)
.IP "\-m" 4
.IX Item "-m"
This enables a minimalistic count of the time remaining, with only the
number of seconds left being displayed. This was the default for delay
1.0.
.IP "\-d" 4
.IX Item "-d"
This enables the default display. The day, hour, minute, and second are
all broken out into seperate entrys. (This is the default, except for the
cases where \-q is the default.)
.IP "\-v" 4
.IX Item "-v"
This enables a more verbose mode of display. (It adds some explanitory 
text, as compared to \-d.)
.IP "\-c" 4
.IX Item "-c"
This allows you to specify a custom time prompt. Printf-style formatting
is performed, with the following being allowed as the possible percent
substitutions:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  %d     Days remaining
\&  %h     Hours remaining (modulo 24)
\&  %m     Minutes remaining (modulo 60)
\&  %s     Seconds remaining (modulo 60)
\&  %n     Total seconds remaining
.Ve
For best results, you'll want to make sure that your custom format stays
the same length throughout the count. Printf-style formatting is done
on these codes. Use of percent-codes other than the ones listed above
will lead to undefined behavior. (Crashes, usually.)
.Sp
The following escapes are also supported:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  \en     Newline
\&  \er     Carriage Return
\&  \eb     Backspace
\&  \e\e     Backslash
\&  \e%     Percent
.Ve
Since the custom format no longer implicitly begins with a carriage return,
it usually makes sense to either begin a custom code with \er or end it 
with \en.
.Sp
The standard formats can be expressed as custom codes. Here's a list of
translations.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  -m    \er% 8n
\&  -d    \er% 3d %02h:%02m:%02s
\&  -v    \erTime Remaining: %d days, %02h:%02m:%02s.
.Ve
.IP "\-C" 4
.IX Item "-C"
This option enables the display of time remaining in big ugly curses
numerals. This only displays the hours, minutes, and seconds
remaining, although the number of hours to go may range above 24.
.IP "\-u" 4
.IX Item "-u"
This option takes a single parameter, the time in seconds between
updates of the time remaining. It need not be a factor of the
delay length. It defaults to 1 second, and must be at least that
value.
.IP "\-b" 4
.IX Item "-b"
If this option is given, a bell character will be sent when time 
expires. This may be useful in cases where an xterm is send to
de-iconify on a bell.
.IP "\-V" 4
.IX Item "-V"
If given, delay will display it's version and a short copyright message,
and will then exit.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
The default format is only good for delays of less than 1000 days.
.PP
Improper use of the \-c option can lead to various problems, and may
even have some security implications.
.PP
\&\fIexecvp\fR\|(2) is used to run the command, and this may run programs 
in the current directory rather than fully respecting your path. Please
see \fIexecvp\fR\|(2) for more details.
